## Article and Research on IF

I have experimented mainly with Daily fasts of 16 hours or 20 hours. As a data scientist, nutritionist and serious athlete, I also come with data. I have data from 2011-2019 of my body weight.

## Article and Research on Food Selection

[Weight gain by macronutrient and insulin response](https://github.com/noahgift/intermittent-fasting/blob/master/weight_gain_foods.ipynb)

A. High Carbohydrate foods appear to be the strongest correlation with weight gain.

B. Fat and Protein are essentially neutral

C. Total Calories and glycemic index are equally as correlated with weight gain.

One firm conclusion would be to avoid calorically dense, high carbohydrate foods that have a high glycemic index: i.e. French Fries.
